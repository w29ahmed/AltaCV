# Waleed-Resume-v1
Source code for my resume built in LaTeX using [liantze](https://github.com/liantze)'s [AltaCV template](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV).

Forked in May 2018 and updated up until December 2020. In those 2 years, a few updates were made to the original template and I wanted to take advantage of those features. (Most notably, the ability to easily adjust the column ratio) This prompted me to fork a fresh copy of the template and migrate to it. See Version 2 [here](https://github.com/w29ahmed/Waleed-Resume-v2).
